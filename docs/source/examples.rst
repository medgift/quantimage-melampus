Preprocessor
*************
.. code-block:: python

    """
    Melampus Preprocessor accepts a csv file with column names. And (optionally) the name of target variable included in the csv file.
    Functions:
    - standarize_data: standarization of data
    - normalize_data: normalization of data with L2 norm
    - dimensionality_reduction: For high dimensional datasets. Reduce the amount of features into a new feature space.
            :parameter number of dimentions in the new feature space

    You can access the transformed dataset on pre.data (format: numpy array)

Classifier
*******************
.. code-block:: python
    """
    Melampus Classifier for logistic regression. Includes all the preprocessor steps as options
            :param filename: The name of the csv file that includes the data
            :param algorithm_name: The name of the desired method. Possible values:
                - logistic_regression: For Logistic Regression
                - lasso_regression: For logistic regression with the l1 penalty
                - elastic_net: For logistic regression with the elastic net penalty
                - random_forest: For Random Forest classifier, an embedded method of decision trees
                - svm: For a Support Vector Machine classifier.
            Optional parameters:
            :param outcomes:  the outcomes as a separated dataset in list format
            :param target_col: name of the target variable if included in the csv dataset
            :param scaling: Standarization of data
            :param dim_red: For high dimensional datasets. Reduce the amount of features into a new feature space.
                            dimred[1] = number of dimentions in the new feature space
            :param normalize: Normalization with L2 data.

    Classifier provides as results the coefficients and the intercepts of the Logistic Regression. These parameters
    are included in mel_clf object (e.g.: mel_clf.coefficients)

Feature Selector
*******************
.. code-block:: python
    """
    Melampus Feature Selector accepts a csv file with column names. And (optionally) the name of target variable included in the csv file.
    Functions:
    - variance_threshold:   It removes all features whose variance doesnâ€™t meet some threshold. By default, it removes all zero-variance features.
